# **TikTok Project**
**Course 4 - The Power of Statistics**

You are a data professional at TikTok. The current project is reaching its midpoint; a project proposal, Python coding work, and exploratory data analysis have all been completed.

The team has reviewed the results of the exploratory data analysis and the previous executive summary the team prepared. You received an email from Orion Rainier, Data Scientist at TikTok, with your next assignment: determine and conduct the necessary hypothesis tests and statistical analysis for the TikTok classification project.

# **Data exploration and hypothesis testing**



1) Do videos from verified accounts and videos unverified accounts have different average view counts?

2) Is there a relationship between the account being verified and the associated videos' view counts?

### **1. Imports and Data Loading**


```python
# Import packages for data manipulation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Import packages for data visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Import packages for statistical analysis/hypothesis testing
from scipy import stats
```


```python
# Load dataset into dataframe
data = pd.read_csv("tiktok_dataset.csv")
```

### **2. Data exploration**




Inspect the first five rows of the dataframe.


```python
# Display first few rows
data.head()
```

You are interested in the relationship between `verified_status` and `video_view_count`. One approach is to examine the mean values of `video_view_count` for each group of `verified_status` in the sample data.


```python
# Compute the mean `video_view_count` for each group in `verified_status`
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
data.groupby("verified_status")["video_view_count"].mean()
```




    verified_status
    not verified    265663.785339
    verified         91439.164167
    Name: video_view_count, dtype: float64



### **Task 3. Hypothesis testing**



*   **Null hypothesis**: There is no difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts.
*    **Alternative hypothesis**: There is a difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts.





Your goal in this step is to conduct a two-sample t-test . Recall the steps for conducting a hypothesis test:


1.   State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis
2.   Choose a signficance level
3.   Find the p-value
4.   Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis



**$H_0$**: There is no difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts.

**$H_A$**: There is a difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts.

You choose 5% as the significance level and proceed with a two-sample t-test.


```python
# Conduct a two-sample t-test to compare means

# Save each sample in a variable
not_verified = data[data["verified_status"] == "not verified"]["video_view_count"]
verified = data[data["verified_status"] == "verified"]["video_view_count"]

# Implement a t-test using the two samples
stats.ttest_ind(a=not_verified, b=verified, equal_var=False)
```




    Ttest_indResult(statistic=25.499441780633777, pvalue=2.6088823687177823e-120)





Since the p-value is much smaller than the significance level of 5%, you reject the null hypothesis. You conclude that there **is** a statistically significant difference in the mean video view count between verified and unverified accounts on TikTok.


### **4. Communicate insights with stakeholders**



The analysis shows that there is a statistically significant difference in the average view counts between videos from verified accounts and videos from unverified accounts. This suggests there might be fundamental behavioral differences between these two groups of accounts.

It would be interesting to investigate the root cause of this behavioral difference. For example, do unverified accounts tend to post more clickbait-y videos? Or are unverified accounts associated with spam bots that help inflate view counts?
